function [dSdt] = BoostAscent_odefun(t,S,consts,thrustVec,Time)
% BOOSTASCENT_odefun
% The goal of this function is to output the derivatives of the current
% state (held in the vector 'S'). These derivatives are calculated using
% fundamental physics, and then are packed together in "dSdt'. 
% 
% ODE45 will pass in time information to this function (since the physics
% are time dependentant), and then will numerically integrate the 
% derivative in the output by something like:
%       S(i+1) = S(i) + dSdt*dt 
% where ODE45 is picking dt.
%
% We need information about the position, velocity, and mass, thus these
% are all of the quantities held in the state vector. Also passed in is a
% constants vector that holds information that the will be needed to
% calculate quanties of interest in this funciton. Finally, there is also
% the trust vector and time vector associated with the thrust vector so
% that we can calculate thrust at any given time using interpolation.

% motion is detected by the following test, set the acceleration to zero
